# Challenge useReducer - Bank Account ðŸ’°

Welcome to the "Challenge useReducer - Bank Account" project! This project is a simple implementation designed to explore and practice the use of React's `useReducer` hook in managing a bank account.

## Overview

The goal of this challenge is to build a basic banking application that allows users to deposit and withdraw funds from their bank account. The project emphasizes the use of `useReducer` for state management, providing a clean and scalable solution for handling complex state logic.
